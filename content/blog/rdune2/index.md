I'm very happy to announce that [{Rdune} has been published on CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rdune/index.html)ðŸŽ‰. What does that mean exactly? And what's next for {Rdune}? Let's dive into it.

### What is CRAN? 

[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) (Comprehensive R Archive Network), maintained by the R Foundation for Statistical Computing, is the primary repository for R packages. It provides storage, distribution, and documentation for R software and its extensions, ensuring consistency and availability of packages across various systems and platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

The major advantage of having a package on CRAN is that it makes it more accessible to users and easier to install. For example, now that {Rdune} is available on CRAN, you no longer need to rely on the developmental version to use it. You can simply run the following command:

```r
install.packages("Rdune")

```
And now it's available for you to enjoy! 


Overall, getting a package accepted on CRAN is difficult, so it feels pretty rewarding once you achieve it. But thatâ€™s one of the great things about R - anyone can contribute and become an R developer.

### What's Next for {Rdune}? 

Well, once the next film comes out, I'll add more palettes. I'll also consider including some from the show that is supposed to air soon.

Until then,
