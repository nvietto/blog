If you're like me and have an unhealthy obsession for the NFL, you've probably thought it would be cool to have some data to mess around with and maybe even make some predictions. You could manually input data into an Excel spreadsheet, straining your eyes for hours on end, or you could use more efficient technique by web-scrapping with {rvest} in R.


Let's scrape the career stats of Jared Goff from the Detroit Lions ü¶Å

## Set up & Scrape

Lets install and load our packages.


We will need the [**tidyverse**](https://www.tidyverse.org/) and [**janitor**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/janitor/vignettes/janitor.html) packages. 


```r
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, rvest, janitor)

```


Next, we need to get the webpage URL [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Goff). And copy it and create an object. 


```r
# here we are creating the URL object
goffstats_url <- 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Goff'


# this reads the html and passes it through the html_table function
goffstats <- read_html(goffstats_url) |> 
  html_table()

```

**Note:** If you‚Äôre curious what html_table() does, copy and paste the following code into your console and press enter: **?html_table** 



TThere are many tricks to locating the correct html table. Pulling up the object (i.e., goffstats) from the environment and then examining the value column to find the correct dimensions of the table you want from the website you scraped (i.e., the wiki page) is my preferred method. 

For example, head [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Goff) and scroll down to NFL career statistics then regular season and count the rows and columns. After you have a decent idea of the dimensions, head to your object (i.e., goff_stats) and try to match the dimensions. Object **[[6]]** with the **value 10 x 23** is the one we want so we create a new object with that information. 

```r
career_stats <- goffstats[[6]]

```

üéâ Alright, we have officially scraped the website and got our HTML table! üéâ



## Cleaning

Alright, here‚Äôs were it gets tricky. We want to use the {janitor} package and its function clean_names(), which transforms all the columns into a data friendly format.

```r
career_stats1 <- career_stats |>
  clean_names() |> 
  as.tibble() |> # I prefer to look at things in tibble format, it's just a bit nicer
  select(- c(rushing, rushing_2, rushing_4, sacked_2)) # this removes the columns that I don't really find important for the QB position

```

Next, we are going to rearrange some of our data table so the character variables are in front of our tibble.

```r

# here I'm creating an object that holds the columns I want to move up front
# we will find out soon why I want these up front

career_statsM <- c("year",
                   "team", 
                   "games_3")


# this create a new object with the non-numerical columns in the front and everything else after it
career_stats2 <- career_stats1 |> 
  select(all_of(career_statsM), everything())


```


Now, we have to do some major cleaning of this data. We are going to rename, slice, and mutate. Examples of these commands can be located [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/main/data-transformation.pdf). 



```r 

career_stats3 <- career_stats2 |>
  rename(games_played = games,  # making these columns a bit easier to understand and work with
         games_started = games_2,
         record = games_3,
         completions = passing,
         attempts = passing_2,
         comp_pct = passing_3,
         yards = passing_4, 
         ypera = passing_5,
         longest_pass = passing_6,
         tds = passing_7,
         intercept = passing_8,
         pass_rate = passing_9,
         rush_ypera = rushing_3,
         rush_td = rushing_5,
         fumbles_lost = fumbles_2) |> 
  slice_tail(n = -1) |> # this slices the top row out of our data frame (i.e., the extra row of column names)
  slice_head(n = -1) |> # this slices the bottom row (i.e., career stats)
  mutate(yards = str_remove_all(yards, ",")) |>  # we don't want a " , " in our variable bc R considers it a string or a character
  mutate(across(4:19, as.numeric)) # Here's why we moved those other columns to the front, so we can easily convert the others to numerics


# this creates a fun interactive table within the html file
interactivetable <- career_stats3 |> 
  knitr::kable()

interactivetable


```

That‚Äôs it! the data is clean and now we can analyze it! üèà


## Analyze 

You can do anything with the data now, but make sure you are using the numeric values.

```r
mean(career_stats3$yards)

```
[1] 3803.625

```r 

mean(career_stats3$tds)

```

[1] 23.125
